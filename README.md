## Stack
NextJS, Bootstrap, Typescript and MongoDB. Testing with Cypress.

### Why this stack?
I chose NextJS primarily to make use of its integrated NodeJS API routes. I didn't feel it was necessary to built a http server with express for such a small project. 
The built-in routing system is also a plus and I also make use of the server side generation Next provides. <br>
Although I don't like bootstrap and I always prefer creating my own CSS solutions with SASS or styled components, I chose it because it's just super quick to create a simple UI with it. <br>
Same thing can be said for MongoDB. Most of the time I would've picked a SQL database but Mongo is easier to setup and it's just good enough for this project. <br>
Typescript is just my current standard when building a new project.
